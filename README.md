# Robot practice for TDD

## It's been long since I have practiced TDD in true spirit.  This is an attempt to do it.

Thanks to this repo [this repo](https://github.com/SarthakMakhija/robot-simulation/)

# Problem definition
A Robot is placed at an initial location in a hypothetical infinite grid. It is capable of moving in specific directions and letting you know its position.
Here are the things that it can do -

+ It can receive some directions to move in the grid
    + Directions could be LEFT / RIGHT / UP / DOWN. A sample direction input is LLRRUUD
+ On receiving a direction, it changes its position
+ It can also move in just one direction, Left Or Right or Up or Down
+ It lets you ask its final position in (x,y) format
